The Denver Ms. Kinky Scouts present sashes to members who have been regularly attending meetings, who actively participate in our efforts, and are a great fit for our sisterhood. Coordinators will approach a new Scout to ask if she would like to be measured for a sash after vetting. We do not typically award more than one new sash per meeting. At this time, we have presented over 50 Kinky Scout sashes in Denver, Colorado. 

### Side Ties
How you secure the ends of your sash is up to you. You may weave rope, ribbon, safety pins, lace, or chain material between the ends of your sash. Feel free to be creative and customize your sash.

### Wear Your Sash
Let your Ms. Kinky Scout pride show! Please feel free to wear your sash to appropriate, kink-friendly events (Gateway, TNG, Thunder in the Mountains, etc.) as often as you would like. They are great conversation starters and help us get to know our community.
