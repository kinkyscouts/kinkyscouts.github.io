### Flair Patches
Flair patches and/or pins are a form of self-expression and fun! They are allowed, with approval, above the name patch on your sash. They are to be no bigger than 4.5 inches long and 3.5 inches wide, and must sit comfortably next to each other. These are optional and are to be provided by the scout.

### Class Patches
The Denver Ms. Kinky Scouts earn roughly six class patches a year through participating in classes, challenges, and hands on activities. Class patches are the circular patches found on the front of each sash. These patches cover both “vanilla” and kinky topics.  Each time we hold a monthly meeting, we alternate between earning class patches and participating in a buffer meeting. 

* Pervertables 
* Self Defense
* Fire Play 
* Petplay
* Auto 101
* Sexual Intellect
* Connecting with Rope

An awesome Scout, Little Samurai, created a template to help you arrange your class patches that can be found here: [https://goo.gl/hGNKyy](https://goo.gl/hGNKyy) and [https://goo.gl/tXhMhM](https://goo.gl/tXhMhM)

### Event Patches
These patches are distributed on a case-by-case basis for special events (example: Wild Nights Zoo Slumber Party) and are to only be on the back of the sash. They can be attached in any pattern or order desired. These patches are always optional and may be funded by scout monthly dues depending on the event. 

* Slumber Party at the Zoo
* Rafting 2016
