### Service Stars 
We want as many folks as possible to get out in their communities. Scouts are encouraged to volunteer within our kink and leather communities as well as at their childrenâ€™s schools, their churches, and their local soup kitchens. 

Star Pins are awarded to Scouts for every 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 hours of service. These pins are to be placed on the front of the sash under our troop number in a single row. Please email [kinkyscouts303@gmail.com](mailto:kinkyscouts303@gmail.com) with your completed service hours to request your star pins. These pins are of no cost to regularly attending members.

### Run Pins
Please feel free to add any run pins you may have collected to the ends of your sash next to your side ties. These pins are often obtained from community events (Thunder in the Mountains, Frolicon, Colorado Leather Fest) or by supporting community members/clubs. Chitters the Squirrel left all the Scouts with a pin after a presentation he gave on Pet Play. This would be a perfect pin to add to the ends of your sash.
