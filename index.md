Kink, Leather, Fetish, and BDSM are not solo sports. They are typically best experienced with a supportive community much like Denver Ms. Kinky Scouts. We are a lively group of women (persons who openly identify as female) working to provide a safe/supportive place for education, personal growth, and community enrichment every fourth Tuesday of the month.

If you would like to make new kinky friends while earning patches and helping the community, this is the group for you!

### Monthly Meetings
The Denver Ms. Kinky Scouts hold a monthly meeting every fourth Tuesday at 7pm. Most of our monthly meetings are open to any new members or visitors who openly identify as female. Please message us for the current month’s meeting location. You may also visit FetLife’s Denver Event Listings for our most current upcoming events.
