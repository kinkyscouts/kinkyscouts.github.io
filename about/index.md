## Requirements to be a Scout

### Participation
Denver Ms. Kinky Scouts deeply values active participation. Creating patches, spreadsheets, events, and promotions is not a simple feat in which we can accomplish alone. We need YOU! Please bring your ideas and contributions. Roll up your sleeves and help us make great things happen. This is not a sedentary group. Your input keeps this group fresh, unique, and clever. 

### Female Identifying
At this time, Denver Ms. Kinky Scouts is for those who openly identify as female. We open monthly meetings and events to the whole community several times a year. Please feel free to connect with us should you have any questions. 

### Monthly Dues and Venue Donations
At each meeting, we collect $5 for monthly dues at the door from each Scout. These funds remain in the Kinky Scout “Kitty” only to be used for Scout meetings and events. These dues also cover the cost of star pins and class patches earned by each Kinky Scout.

Finding welcoming, kink-friendly venues like the one we currently have can be a challenge. The Denver Ms. Kinky Scouts are grateful to have a large, safe space to meet each month. We enthusiastically encourage any donations (ideally $5 a meeting) to help keep the lights on and the building warm. 

Please do not let a lack of funds discourage you from checking out a meeting. We will work with you if money is an issue.
